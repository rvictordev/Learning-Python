# # Variable = A container for a value (String, Integer, Float, Boolean)
# #            A variable behaves as if it was the value it contains 

# # Strings - are a series of characters that can include numbers but treated as characters. Strings are inside the quote (") or (')

# quantity = 2
# num_of_students = 30

# print(f"You are {age} years old")
# print(f"You are buying {quantity} items")

# print(f"The price is ${price}")
# print(f"My gpa is: {gpa}")

# # Boolean - it is a True or False value

# true = True
# false = False

# String Methods - are functions that can be used to manipulate strings
name = "bro code"

# print(len(name)) - returns the length of the string
# print(name[0])  # returns the first character of the string
# print(name[1])  # returns the second character of the string
# print(name.upper()) - converts the string to uppercase
# print(name.upper())  # BRO CODE
# print(name.lower())  # bro code
# print(name.capitalize())  # Bro code
# print(name.title())  # Bro Code
# print(name.find("c"))  # returns the index of the first occurrence of "c"
# print(name.find("z"))  # returns -1 if "z" is not found
# print(name.isdigit())  # returns True if the string is a digit
# print(name.isalpha())  # returns True if the string is alphabetic -- no numbers or symbols or spaces
# print(name.count("o"))  # returns the number of occurrences of "o" in the string
# print(name.replace("o", "a"))  # returns the number of occurrences of "o" in the string
# print(name*3)  # returns the string repeated 3 times
